My Python implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing System - Run through command line interface

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing

Takes a data file and splits it into a configurable number of encrypted files

The original data is only able to be recovered if configured number of files are available

Importantly: The number of files to decrypt may be less than the total
